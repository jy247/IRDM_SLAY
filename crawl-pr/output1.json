But after studying drug addicts in the laboratory, his results strongly indicated that drugs weren\u2019t as powerful as they were believed to be, at least not when another attractive, more rational option is presented as an alternative. These findings led him to question the veracity of his initial hypothesis \u2014 that it was illicit drugs that caused the downward spiral of individuals such as his cousin, a crackhead who lived in a backyard shed. This, in turn, led to one of his more controversial theories: that using illicit drugs is a symptom of the socioeconomic conditions in which people are forced to live.", "\u201cThe key factor is the environment,\u201d Hart said. \u201cIf you\u2019re living in a poor neighborhood deprived of options, there\u2019s a certain rationality to keep taking a drug that will give you some temporary pleasure.\u201d In his hometown of New York, Hart works to improve conditions for socioeconomically deprived communities.

But after studying drug addicts in the laboratory, his results strongly indicated that drugs weren\u2019t as powerful as they were believed to be, at least not when another attractive, more rational option is presented as an alternative. These findings led him to question the veracity of his initial hypothesis \u2014 that it was illicit drugs that caused the downward spiral of individuals such as his cousin, a crackhead who lived in a backyard shed.

But after studying drug addicts in the laboratory, his results strongly indicated that drugs weren\u2019t as powerful as they were believed to be, at least not when another attractive, more rational option is presented as an alternative. These findings led him to question the veracity of his initial hypothesis \u2014 that it was illicit drugs that caused the downward spiral of individuals such as his cousin, a crackhead who lived in a backyard shed.

Whether it\u2019s Animal House, Caddyshack, GhostBusters, or Stripes, the enemy seems to be an authoritarian, often military system that imposes an unreasonable order on people. Since the Dean Wermers of the world are inflexible and can\u2019t be reasoned with, our heroes must undermine and explode their authority, resorting to the kind of chaos and anarchy (TOGA PARTIES!) which are necessary to restore order and remake the world. Ramis\u2019 films\u2019 revolt is as much against an inflexible organization as it is against unyielding individual psyches (as in Groundhog Day and Ice Harvest). Some of our guest\u2019s first practical lessons in revolting against authority were developed right here at WU.

He is a world-class scientist who has been awarded multiple multimillion dollar grants to study the complex interactions between recreational drugs and the neurobiological and environmental factors that mediate human behavior and physiology. He has co-authored a leading college-level textbook in the area of drug use and drug abuse entitled Drug, Society, and Human Behavior. Hart has published several editorials in publications around the world, including The New York Times and O\u2019 Global (Brazil).", "Since Richard Nixon declared war on drugs in 1971, the U.S. government, law enforcement, media and scientific communities have emphasized the damaging effects and dangers of illicit drugs. The message was clear: all drugs are bad. Some of the more famous slogans, such as \u201cJust Say No,\u201d and \u201cThis Is Your Brain on Drugs,\u201d accompanied by an image of frying eggs, solidly reinforced the message. More than four decades later, Hart implores a closer look at his research data, which debunks some of the most entrusted scientific evidence of drug addiction.", "In his presentation, Hart described his extraordinary journey from an impoverished childhood, to drug user and dealer, to distinguished professor and researcher, as outlined in his 2013 book, \u201cHigh Price: A Neuroscientist\u2019s Journey of Self-Discovery That Challenges Everything You Know About Drugs and Society.\u201d The book combines scientific evidence with his life experiences, and won the 2014 PEN/E.O.

As a child, Hart had experienced addiction\u2019s devastation and despair, and conquered many obstacles to be in a position to stop such widespread destruction. But after studying drug addicts in the laboratory, his results strongly indicated that drugs weren\u2019t as powerful as they were believed to be, at least not when another attractive, more rational option is presented as an alternative. These findings led him to question the veracity of his initial hypothesis \u2014 that it was illicit drugs that caused the downward spiral of individuals such as his cousin, a crackhead who lived in a backyard shed. This, in turn, led to one of his more controversial theories: that using illicit drugs is a symptom of the socioeconomic conditions in which people are forced to live.", "\u201cThe key factor is the environment,\u201d Hart said. \u201cIf you\u2019re living in a poor neighborhood deprived of options, there\u2019s a certain rationality to keep taking a drug that will give you some temporary pleasure.\u201d In his hometown of New York, Hart works to improve conditions for socioeconomically deprived communities.

But after studying drug addicts in the laboratory, his results strongly indicated that drugs weren\u2019t as powerful as they were believed to be, at least not when another attractive, more rational option is presented as an alternative. These findings led him to question the veracity of his initial hypothesis \u2014 that it was illicit drugs that caused the downward spiral of individuals such as his cousin, a crackhead who lived in a backyard shed.

Its essence lies in its ability to subvert order, the status quo, to provoke change. It teaches us to question and by extension, it teaches us to revolt against authority. We may laugh at the comedy\u2019s absurdist tactics, but the lesson is very clear: sometimes it\u2019s necessary to resort to extremes, and employ humor, farce \u2013 as a means of overturning something patently unjust or impervious to human reason.

Whether it\u2019s Animal House, Caddyshack, GhostBusters, or Stripes, the enemy seems to be an authoritarian, often military system that imposes an unreasonable order on people. Since the Dean Wermers of the world are inflexible and can\u2019t be reasoned with, our heroes must undermine and explode their authority, resorting to the kind of chaos and anarchy (TOGA PARTIES!) which are necessary to restore order and remake the world. Ramis\u2019 films\u2019 revolt is as much against an inflexible organization as it is against unyielding individual psyches (as in Groundhog Day and Ice Harvest). Some of our guest\u2019s first practical lessons in revolting against authority were developed right here at WU.

But after studying drug addicts in the laboratory, his results strongly indicated that drugs weren\u2019t as powerful as they were believed to be, at least not when another attractive, more rational option is presented as an alternative. These findings led him to question the veracity of his initial hypothesis \u2014 that it was illicit drugs that caused the downward spiral of individuals such as his cousin, a crackhead who lived in a backyard shed. This, in turn, led to one of his more controversial theories: that using illicit drugs is a symptom of the socioeconomic conditions in which people are forced to live.", "\u201cThe key factor is the environment,\u201d Hart said. \u201cIf you\u2019re living in a poor neighborhood deprived of options, there\u2019s a certain rationality to keep taking a drug that will give you some temporary pleasure.\u201d In his hometown of New York, Hart works to improve conditions for socioeconomically deprived communities.

The groundbreaking work of American anthropologist Franz Boas proved that some human traits could be changed by their environment.", "Boas\u2019 work, along with a re-synthesis of earlier work by Darwin and Mendel, helped build scientific support for a new and powerful anthropological concept of culture \u2014 the idea that how and what humans thought mainly was related to their life history, education and socialization.", "Sussman, who has taught at the university since 1973, does extensive fieldwork in primate behavior and ecology in Costa Rica, Guyana, Madagascar and Mauritius.
